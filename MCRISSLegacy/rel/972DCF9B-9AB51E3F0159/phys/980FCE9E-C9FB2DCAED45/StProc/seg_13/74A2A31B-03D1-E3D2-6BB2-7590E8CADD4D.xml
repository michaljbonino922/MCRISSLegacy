The #SUBORGS table will be populated with all OrgIDs that are in the child hierarchy 
of the input @OrgID.  USED is a bit that is necessary for popula.ng the data 
to .ag whether an OrgID's children have been joined yet.  This is to make 
sure the direct children of an OrgID are only inserted once. 
 
The #IDS table is used only to temporarily store the OrgIDs that children are being 
retrieved for.  Because it is an itera.ve process, this table is necessary so that 
we know which OrgIDs to toggle the USED .ag on in the #SUBORGS table.
