to .ag whether an OrgID's children have been joined yet.  This is to make 
sure the direct children of an OrgID are only inserted once. 
 
The #IDS table is used only to temporarily store the OrgIDs that children are being 
retrieved for.  Because it is an itera.ve process, this table is necessary so that 
we know which OrgIDs to toggle the USED .ag on in the #SUBORGS table.
